NAME
    Chicle - a simple framework for writing and publishing LaTeX documents

SYNOPSIS
    make [default|all|pdf|ps|dvi|print|view|preview|...]

    make help|man

DESCRIPTION
    Chicle is a simple framework for writing and publishing LaTeX documents.

  What does chicle mean?
    Chicle is the gum from Manilkara chicle, a species of sapodilla tree. It
    is a tropical evergreen tree, native to in Central America and South
    America. It is the traditional material used in chewing gum.

    The tree is also grown for its fruit which is plum-sized and has a
    translucent brown flesh. The tapping of the gum is similar to the
    tapping of latex from the rubber tree. Zigzag gashes are made in the
    tree trunk and the dripping gum is collected in small bags. Locals who
    collect chicle are called chicleros. This is then boiled till it reaches
    the correct thickness. Widespread tapping has lead to the tree becoming
    scarce and other sources like the related Balat√° (Manilkara bidentata)
    are being increasingly used. Many modern chewing gums use petroleum
    based plastic instead of chicle.

    Chicle was well known to the Aztec and Maya Indians and the early
    European settlers prized it for its subtle flavour and high sugar
    content.

  Requirements
    Chicle needs some external programs to work. Most of them are
    configurable (see "CONFIGURATION" for more information like default
    values and how to change them).

    *         GNU make

    *         LaTeX, pdfTeX and BibTeX

    *         latexmk

              Version 3.07a is provided in the bin/ directory.

    *         ps2pdf, epstopdf and psnup

    *         PDF viewer (e.g. *xpdf*)

    *         PS viewer (e.g. *gv*)
